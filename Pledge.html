  Let's Take A Pledge .
    </h1>


    <p>• Mahatma Gandhi secured freedom for Mother India.</p>
    
   <p> •Now it is our duty to serve Mother India by keeping the country neat and clean.
    </p>

  <p>•  I take this pledge that I will remain committed towards cleanliness and devote time for this.</p>
<p> • I will devote 100 hours per year, that is two hours per week, to voluntarily work for cleanliness.</p>
<p> • I will neither litter not let others litter.</p>
<p> • I will initiate the quest for cleanliness with myself, my family, my locality, my village and my work place.</p>
<p> • With this firm belief, I will propagate the message of Swachh Bharat Mission in villages and towns.
</p>
<p> • I will encourage 100 other persons to take this pledge which I am taking today.</p>
<p> • I will endeavour to make them devote their 100 hours for cleanliness.</p>
